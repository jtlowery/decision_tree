# decision_tree
A simple implementation of a decision tree made as practice while trying to wrap my head around Scala and functional programmming.

# Future Work
- ~~Add support for splitting on continuous variables~~
- ~~Refactor so that splits are made on functions not specific values~~
- ~~Add Gini impurity~~
- ~~Add tests for fit and predict~~
  * ~~Simple tests~~
- Clean up all the hard to follow tuple indexing
  * Done somewhat?
- Compare to performance of other packages
- Extend for regression
- Extend for random forests
- Extend for gbm
