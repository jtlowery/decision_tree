# decision_tree
A simple implementation of a decision tree made as practice while trying to wrap my head around Scala and functional programmming.

# Future Work
- Add support for continuous variables
- ~~Refactor so that splits are made on functions not specific values~~
- Add tests for fit and predict
  * ~~Simple tests~~
- Extend for random forests
